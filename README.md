# Prefix Tree Homework

This project contains solutions for two tasks related to prefix trees (Trie) as part of a homework assignment.

## Task 1: Extended Trie Functionality
- Implements `Homework` class with methods:
  - `count_words_with_suffix`: Counts words ending with a given suffix.
  - `has_prefix`: Checks if any word starts with a given prefix.
- Includes tests for functionality, case sensitivity, error handling, and performance.

## Task 2: Longest Common Prefix
- Implements `LongestCommonWord` class with method:
  - `find_longest_common_word`: Finds the longest common prefix for a list of strings.
- Includes tests for common prefix detection, edge cases, and invalid inputs.

## Files
- `trie.py`: Base Trie implementation.
- `homework.py`: Solution for Task 1.
- `longest_common_word.py`: Solution for Task 2.

## Usage
Run each file to execute tests:
```bash
python3 homework.py
python3 longest_common_word.py
```
